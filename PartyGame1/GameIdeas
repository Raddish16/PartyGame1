Game ideas

Yasuki's

Deflect projectiles like pong with a movable charachter
- Each player controls a charachter with control stick 1, aim with control stick 2
- Toggle "shield" on and off. Shield is a front-facing rectangle in front which can reflect projectiles like pong would
- Shield drains when on, recharges when off
- When shield is off, you can shoot projectiles with your charachter
- Projectiles will keep bouncing off walls and shields
- As game continues, density of projectiles increases until one player left standing
- Powerups like increased firerate, increased projecitle speed, wider shield, invulnerability, etc
- Alternate game mode could include launching yourself instead of launching projectiles

Aircraft game with teams of 2
- One player controls the flight and forward facing weapons, the other is a gunner controlling a turret, like WWII bombers
- One mode is versus where the objective is to shoot down the other players' planes
- Second mode could be a "cooperative" mode where every player is on the same side, trying to reach a destination while
  being attacked by smaller planes, whoever makes it first, or the last plane alive, is the winner
- Potential issues include making an "AI" for the small attackers
- Certain inputs for evasive manuevers
- Rechargeable speed boost, recharge increased when killing an enemy
- Various weapons/planes
- Top-down view and controls would be easiest to implement, controls like the game Luftrausers would be a lot more fun

Key Aspects of Party Games
  Random chance/wrench being thrown into your plans at every turn
      Mario party- bowser, mariokart- blue shells, guitar hero- hard line of music
  Skill, but not so that inexperienced canâ€™t play, still easy at the same time
  Collaboration, combinations of team ups
  Competition/betrayal
  Progression/currency
  Variety of minigames
  Customization of character
  High stakes, intense
  Setting change, interesting scenery 
  4-8 players, sometimes more
  You have to try hard to do well
  Suspense
  Absurd situations, unique challenges
  Basically a game where four or more people compete at a variety of similar tasks and see who is the best

Feel free to critique and change, I also want to hear your ideas for a game and we can try to combine them

16-bit conspiracy(Our graphics can kind of be retro looking, or not)

  Everyone chooses a character(or randomly given character?)
  Each have abilities(take inspiration from any super hero/game character)
  Abilities give leg up in certain situations
  Mini games like Mario party, but all Atari style games(like frogger, pacman, but don't rip off established iconic games. Think of new ones.)
      Not too much like Mario party. Don't want to be a knock-off
  Tournaments, and team ups
  Something like mafia?
  Winner gets to be puppet master the next game. 
  Mario party takes too long, something shorter, but yet still fun
  
  Characters
    Puppet master
    Murderer
    Healer
    Sheriff
    Rogue/vigilante
    Townspeople
    
  at the end of every round the characters use their special abilities on one person
  Have minor abilities to use in the rounds
  Has to be some sort of perk to being puppet master, maybe they switch off so that everyone has a turn and overall they accumulate points from round to round

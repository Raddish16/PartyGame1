Game ideas

Yasuki's

Deflect projectiles like pong with a movable charachter
- Each player controls a charachter with control stick 1, aim with control stick 2
- Toggle "shield" on and off. Shield is a front-facing rectangle in front which can reflect projectiles like pong would
- Shield drains when on, recharges when off
- When shield is off, you can shoot projectiles with your charachter
- Projectiles will keep bouncing off walls and shields
- As game continues, density of projectiles increases until one player left standing
- Powerups like increased firerate, increased projecitle speed, wider shield, invulnerability, etc
- Alternate game mode could include launching yourself instead of launching projectiles

Aircraft game with teams of 2
- One player controls the flight and forward facing weapons, the other is a gunner controlling a turret, like WWII bombers
- One mode is versus where the objective is to shoot down the other players' planes
- Second mode could be a "cooperative" mode where every player is on the same side, trying to reach a destination while
  being attacked by smaller planes, whoever makes it first, or the last plane alive, is the winner
- Potential issues include making an "AI" for the small attackers
- Certain inputs for evasive manuevers
- Rechargeable speed boost, recharge increased when killing an enemy
- Various weapons/planes
- Top-down view and controls would be easiest to implement, controls like the game Luftrausers would be a lot more fun

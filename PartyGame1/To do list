To do list

I figured out how to fix the UI, im tired so I will do it tommorow. 

state is currently set to gamestate. I am using another state which gamestate is ticking and rendering. If you want to work on menustate
you can change the current state in the game class, or if you want to work on another game you can set a boolean
in gamestate to false to stop my game from ticking and rendering

yasuki - I am in the process of making frogger playable inside partygame, feel free to finish it if you can get the UI working as 
shoot frogger will take longer than expected due to my inneficient sprites from then, as well as the handler, and the new parameters required in the constructor
may not be worth it. 

Minigame classes which extends gamestate? Gamestate to manage the overall party game, and minigame classes can be loaded by it.

Come up with character avatars

Decide which games to create
Work out game mechanics

We should use more notes, and organize things better. Also, use the formatting key to make consistent coding.

And much more we haven't run into yet...f

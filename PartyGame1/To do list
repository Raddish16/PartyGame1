To do list

I altered the plane class, hope you don't mind, but I think they should start somewhere on the left side of the screen, maybe in the upper corner
I added an arraylist of planes, and they each randomly select and save a move method when they are created
I tried to create some functions, but I'm going to attempt a parabolic shape


I’m going to try and make some graphics for the menu, I’m thinking the title will be 32-bit conspiracy but it can change
-can you put the graphics you have in the textures folder when you're done?

UI fixed



yasuki - I am in the process of making frogger playable inside partygame, feel free to finish it if you can get the UI working as 
shoot frogger will take longer than expected due to my inneficient sprites from then, as well as the handler, and the new parameters required in the constructor
may not be worth it. 

Minigame classes which extends gamestate? Gamestate to manage the overall party game, and minigame classes can be loaded by it.

Come up with character avatars

Decide which games to create
Work out game mechanics

We should use more notes, and organize things better. Also, use the formatting key to make consistent coding.

And much more we haven't run into yet...f
